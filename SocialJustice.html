Rape is not irrelevant to other struggles for equality, but rather foundational to how systems of oppression in the U.S. including systemic racism, ableism, sexism and homophobia were created and how they persist today.

Wednesday at 6 p.m., 100 survivors are gathering for a free and public town hall at the University of Baltimore Business Center. This event will build political voice and power for survivors, so that we can affect the systems that so deeply impact our lives.<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/opinion/op-ed/bs-ed-sexual-violence-20160405-story.html">Rape Is A social Justice</td>

		<td class= "column2" >"Over the past year, the #MeToo movement and the Times Up initiative have enabled famous women to speak out, then ordinary women, too. There has never been a moment in history when more people have publicly shared their experiences of sexual assault. All of us who have been hassled, molested and assaulted, pre- and post-puberty, all of us who have felt ready to put up our hands and say me too, have embraced a hashtag that has enabled us to connect and show the ubiquity of rape. No more hiding, no more shame; what has been done to us hurts and keeps hurting, and there is solace in sharing."<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/22/rape-why-isnt-justice-being-done">The Guardian</td></td>
